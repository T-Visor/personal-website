      I am passionate about the transformative possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. 
      With hands-on experience in both computer vision and natural language processing, 
      I have worked extensively with advanced models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) for research and prototyping.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg">
      In addition to my work in AI, I am also a passionate part-time photographer, often found behind the camera capturing moments of creativity and inspiration.
